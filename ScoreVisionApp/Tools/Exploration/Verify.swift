     Takes a photo, finds the face within it, and tries to compare it against a face you have already enrolled into a gallery.To verify a face that you have enrolled in your gallery, all you need to do is submit a JPG or PNG photo. You can submit the photo either as a publicly accessible URL, Base64 encoded photo or as a file upload.Next, specify which gallery and subject ID we should search against to compare. These are the same names you used previously during the /enroll calls to create the gallery.Note: As long as the request is able to perform a match then you will receive a status of "success". You should use the "confidence" value to determine whether the comparison is valid for your application. We find that confidence values in excess of 60% are almost always of the same person.
